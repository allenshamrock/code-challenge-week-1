Week 1 phase-1 code challenges

This is a code challenge for week 1 for Moringa school phase 1. The challenge had three code challenges and I was supposed to solve the challenge within 2 days.

Student grade generator(Toy problem)

This is a challenge in creating a user to input student scores. The input should be between 0 and 100.
Then output the correct grade:
A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C - 59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

First challenge solution

I used the prompt in built function to enable the user input the scores of the students
I used different variables for storing data 
I used the if else statements to manage the control flow to assign more than one alternatives
used the alert in build function to output the grade after the user inputs the student's score


Speed detector(Toy problem)

The challenge was to create an input on the speed of a car.
If the input was less than 70, it would need to print "OK"
If not the code solution should calculate 1 demerit point for every extra 5 km/h.
The maximum demerit points was supposed to be 12 which further would print "License Suspended

Second challenge solution

I declared various variables to hold data and do some calcullation needed in this challenge
I have implemented some arithmetic to compute and find the values of the demrit points
I have used the if else statements to run some conditions in the challenge


Net salary calculator(toy problem)

The challenge was to write a program whose major task is to calculate an individualâ€™s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits.
It was also to calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary.
The PAYEE, NSSF, and NHIF deduction rates were given in the challenge.

Third challenge solution
 I used the if else statement to write the conditions of the quiz
 I used arithmetic operations to calculate the PAYEE,NHIF, NSSF deductions, housing levy from the given gross salary
